           A tool to compare audio files in time and frequency
                            Version 1.5.19

DFasma is an open-source software used to compare audio files in time and
frequency. The comparison is first visual, using wavforms and spectra.
It is also possible to listen to time-frequency segments in order to allow
perceptual comparison.

This software is coded in C/C++ using the Qt library (http://qt-project.org).
It is stored as a GitLab project (https://gitlab.com/gillesdegottex/dfasma).


### Goals
* The interface and the audio files should be loaded as quickly as possible.
* Any kind of lossless audio files should be easily loaded (it currently
  uses libsndfile, which support ~25 different formats).
* All features should run on Linux, OS X and Windows operating systems.
* Manage mono audio files (tracks of multi-channel files (e.g. stereo) can
  be loaded separately. A more advanced management of multi-channel files
  could be addressed in the future)
* Even though there are basic functionnalities to align the signals in
  time and amplitude, this software does not aim to be an audio editor.
